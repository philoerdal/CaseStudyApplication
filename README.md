Case study application of university magazine

# Functionality of application: 
This software engineering application is designed with a layered architecture, consisting of four layers: 
data access, persistence, business logic, and presentation. 
The data access layer is responsible for retrieving data from a database, while the persistence layer handles the storage and retrieval of objects in memory. 
The business logic layer manages the application's functionality, including the process of selecting and publishing articles for the magazine. 
The presentation layer provides the user interface, allowing users to interact with the application. 
The system features a registration process for users and authors, submission functionality for articles, and an evaluation process by area editors. 
The editor in chief selects the articles to be published and creates a table of contents for the new issue, which is then sent as a publication alert to registered users. 
Registered users can access the contents of an issue and submit comments on published articles, which the main author can respond to. 
The system also generates alerts and notifications to keep editors and contributors informed of the publication process.
